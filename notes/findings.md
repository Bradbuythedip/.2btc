# Puzzle Analysis Findings

## Key Patterns Discovered

1. Triangular Pattern Analysis
   - 36 dots arranged in 8 rows
   - Row counts: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 dots
   - Creates perfect triangular sequence

2. Symbol Sequence Interpretation
   - △ (triangle): Diagonal pattern reading
   - ❒ (box): Grid-based transformation
   - ● (circle): Rotation or cyclic pattern
   - △ (triangle): Second diagonal transformation
   - ⧉ (grid): Position mapping
   - ▣ (filled box): Final state

3. Mathematical Relationships
   - Diagonal positions: [0,2,5,9,14,20,27,35]
   - Triangle numbers: [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28]
   - Known byte positions (7→9, 22→22, 25→7)

4. Base58 Analysis
   - Word "have" positions identified
   - Possible character mapping pattern
   - Base58 alphabet index relationships

## Current Hypotheses

1. The triangular dot pattern represents:
   - Either a transformation matrix
   - Or a sequence of Base58 indices
   - Or a combination of both

2. The symbol sequence indicates:
   - A specific order of operations
   - Multiple transformation stages
   - Verification checkpoints

3. The known byte positions:
   - Act as verification points
   - Guide the transformation process
   - Validate intermediate results

## Next Steps

1. Further investigate:
   - Additional mathematical relationships
   - Alternative reading patterns
   - Base58 encoding variations

2. Explore:
   - Different transformation sequences
   - Alternative symbol interpretations
   - New mathematical approaches

3. Validate:
   - Results against known positions
   - Base58 encoding patterns
   - Mathematical relationships
